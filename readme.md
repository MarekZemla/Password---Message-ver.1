### Form for entering the password. The password is entered with visible letters (you can change this to "password" in html, then the letters will be dotted) I wanted to make the password disappearing  immediately after typing it correctly. When entering the correct password, a message is displayed that the password has been entered correctly. if the wrong password is entered, nothing happens.

### to check if it works, enter the password # user
